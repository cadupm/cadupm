### Hi, everyone 👋
I am a computer engineer looking for opportunities and collabaration in projects related to backend specially w/ NodeJS.
- 🔭 I’m currently building projects about server-side using SOLID principles and clean architecture at most of the part (also, I am brushing up my data structures, security and algorithms skills regularly).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build a world class server and increase network security.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on javascript and nodeJs projects.
